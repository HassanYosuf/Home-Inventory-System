# Home-Inventory-System

In this project, i have build a home inventory manager program. This program lets you keep a
record of your belongings.


The idea of the program is to enter and/or view descriptive information about each item in your
inventory. You can enter:

<h4>Inventory Item</h4> - A description of the item (required)</br>
<h4>Location</h4> - Description of where item is located</br>
<h4>Marked </h4>- Indicates if item is marked with some kind of identifying
<h4>information (social security number, driverâ€™s license number,
phone number)</br>
<h4>Serial</h4> - Number Item serial number</br>
<h4>Purchase Price</h4> - How much you paid for the item.</br>
<h4>Date Purchased</h4> - When you purchased the item.</br>
<h4>Store/Website</h4>  - Where you purchased the item.</br>
<h4>Photo View</h4> - a stored JPEG photo of the item.</br>
<h4>Note Any additional information about the item.</h4></br>
