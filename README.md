# Home-Inventory-System

In this project, i have build a home inventory manager program. This program lets you keep a
record of your belongings.


The idea of the program is to enter and/or view descriptive information about each item in your
inventory. You can enter:

<h5>Inventory Item</h5> - A description of the item (required)</br>
<h5>Location</h5> - Description of where item is located</br>
<h5>Marked </h5>- Indicates if item is marked with some kind of identifying
<h5>information (social security number, driverâ€™s license number,
phone number)</br>
<h5>Serial</h5> - Number Item serial number</br>
<h5>Purchase Price</h5> - How much you paid for the item.</br>
<h5>Date Purchased</h5> - When you purchased the item.</br>
<h5>Store/Website</h5>  - Where you purchased the item.</br>
<h5>Photo View</h5> - a stored JPEG photo of the item.</br>
<h5>Note Any additional information about the item.</h5></br>
